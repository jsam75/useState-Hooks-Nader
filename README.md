# useState-Hooks-Nader

These are exercises from the Tech with Nader YouTube channel.  It was a long, but very useful exercise tutorial video.  I am documenting the incremental steps to learning React.  
So far, I can only choose one component to render in the main.jsx file, but there are a total of 5 exercise (a warmup + 3 exercises + a bonus) folders in this app.  

Note: Exercise 2 was done in a convoluted way on purpose.  It's an intermediate step towards learning better ways of writing code in React.  It's not meant for real world use.
